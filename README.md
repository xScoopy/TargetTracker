# TargetTracker
Fall Intensive 2020 

This is the TargetTracker. With a double-click on the target area, a dot will be placed for the arrow position, and a score will be added to the next arrow without a score. The help button located on the left side of the screen displays an alert to describe how to work with the target tracker. 

# Features added after the fact
I was able to add a 'save' button that logs scores to a list at the bottom of the page. This is a placeholder for when I'm able to build a backend to save the data. The button also clears the target and the fields to allow for another 5 arrows without refreshing the page. 

# Motivation

My motivation for this project was to help out my younger brother with his archery. He just picked up the hobby, and is very interested on improving/checking his progress. If I can one day get this app to save data, I'll be able to deliver data reports and visualizations that are useful to those that use it. 
It seems there isn't really any electronic method of scoring used for archery. It also seems it would be difficult to come up with an electronic scorekeeping method, but if I'm able to do that, this would be a solid product to market at archery clubs to save on the stacks of paper they use to currently keep score!

# TargetTracker
Fall Intensive 2020 

This is the TargetTracker. With a double-click on the target area, a dot will be placed for the arrow position, and a score will be added to the next arrow without a score. 

My motivation for this project was to help out my younger brother with his archery. He just picked up the hobby, and is big on improving/checking progress. If i can one day get this app to save data, i'll be able to deliver data reports and visualizations that are useful to those that use it.
